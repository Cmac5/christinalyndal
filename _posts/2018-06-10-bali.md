After taking a redundancy from a company I worked at for nearly 10yrs, I wasn't sure what to do with myself. Travel is my default setting and I already had a holiday planned for the next month so I extended it by a week so I'd be away for 4 weeks and decided to enjoy and break and work it all out when I returned from this trip.&nbsp;

After an amazing 4 weeks away I returned home to my very nice but very expensive Sydney apartment and starting planning more travel for the rest of the year and that's when I came across a travel blogger that was hosting a live webinar that night about how he and his partner travel the work full time, they were really inspirational so I signed up for their online course (which I'm still in the process of completing) and they had a section 20 ways to make money online and one thing in particular caught my attention....Coding!

And this is how I came across the Institute of Code (IOC). They run 10 day coding course (some people call them bootcamps or retreats) where you learn to code (build websites) without any previous experience! Sounds too good to be true but it's not, I signed up and attended one of their web development courses in June 2018 and after just 10 days had build 3 websites (including this one!). What appealed to me the most about becoming a web developer though was the complete freedom and flexibility to be able to work from anywhere you want, whenever you want!&nbsp;
